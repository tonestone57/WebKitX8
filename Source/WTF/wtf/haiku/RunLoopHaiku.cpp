/*
The main idea behind this implementation of RunLoop for Haiku is to use a
BHandler to receive messages. WebKit uses one RunLoop per thread, including
the main thread, which already has a BApplication on it. So,

* If we're on the main thread, we attach the BHandler to the existing
  BApplication, or
* If we're on a new thread, we create a new BLooper ourselves and attach the
  BHandler to it.

Either way, the RunLoop should then be ready to handle messages sent to it.
